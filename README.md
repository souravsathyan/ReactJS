#react
react
    -core of reacr library
    -for creating react components, handling component lifecycle and state management
reactDOM 
    -for working with DOM
    -rendering react components into DOM

react element - Dom element

React.createElement("elementName",{id/class},"content"/can be anthoter reactELement / can be an array of reactELement)
    -it creates an object
    -when we renders it into the DOM it becomes an Element

ReactRoot = for creating a root to inject the reactElement
    - ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElmentById("root))

React Component
    -component
        2-types
            -class based components (oldest method)
            -functional components (new method)
    -just a js function which returns a jsx element
    -starts with capital letter
    -easy defenition => a fnction which returns a jsx element

COMPONENT COMPOSITION
    -Inserting component in another component 

package.json = configuration for npm and tracks the version of the npm

package-lock.json = keeps all the records of the versions that are used while the developement of the application.

node_modules = like a database that need to function for the npm packages

transitive dependecny = a chain of interlinked components dependent on each other.
    in npm it is the chain of dependency which are not installed direct but by the direct dependency or trasitive dependency

bundler = used to package the application to be ready for served in browser

tilde(~) and caret(^) in package.json
    ~ means all future updates without incerementing the minor version. eg. 1.2.3 to 1.3.0
    ^ means all future updates without incrementing the major version. eg. 1.2.3 to < 2.0.0

npx = used to execute the npm package

#parcel
    -refer this [https://medium.com/@nikhildhariwal2004/parcel-is-a-beast-an-all-in-one-bundle-for-powerful-web-development-e79f8a70cbd6]
    -refer docs => https://parceljs.org/
    - development build
    -Creates a local server
    - HMR - hot module replacement - like nodemon
        -> how? it uses a File Watching Algorith writtent in c++
    -Faster builds
        -> how? It caches our code in a space called .parcel-cache so it enables faster builds
    -Image Optimization
        - using image transformer
        -also includes lossless image optimization
    -Minification of our file when in production mode
    -Bundling
    -Compressing
    -consistent Hashing - generating unique names for cache. to ensure that browser fetches latest files
    -Differential bundling - bndling differently for each browsers
    -Diagnostic of errors in terminal
    -Error Handling = displaying the errors in browsers
    -HTTPS = can be hosted in https
    - different dev and prod bundles
    -Tree Shaking - avaoiding unwanted functions
    prod build cmd = npx parcel build index.html 
    -dist folder keeps all the bundeled files
    

#JSX
    - developed by facebook devlopers
    -a javascript syntax which is easier to create react 
    -jsx is different than react
        -y? jsx is a syntax, jsx makes implementing the react easy
    -event without jsx we can write react
    -NOT A HTML IN JS
    -IT IS HTML LIKE SYNTAX
    -JSX also creates a object like the React.createElement()
    -jsx is not a valid js / pure js
    -js engine not understasnd jsx but parcel transpile code with the help of **Babel** before the code goes to js engine and make it understatndable for the js engine
    -prevents cross site scripting attacks by sanitizing data
    -

jsx example
    const heading = React.createElement("h1", { id: "head" }, "React Master Class")
    above is the react elemet using react
    below is react element uing the jsx
    const jsxHeading = <h1>Namaste REact using JSX</h1>
    wrap it inside parenthesis for multiple lines

#Babel 
    -Babel is a JS compiler 
    -Transpiles the code before it reaches the JS Engine and makes it understatndable by the JS engine. By the help of the Babel(JSX to JS).
    -It Converts the JSX to React.createElement - a JS Obj => then to HTMLElement(render)
        * without jsx  => React.createElement - a JS Obj => then to HTMLElement(render)
    -


// const elem = <span>REac span element</span>
// const HeadingComponent = () => (
//     <div>
//         <h1 className='myHeading'>Namaste React</h1>
//     </div>
// )
// const jsxHeading = (
//     <div>
//         <h1>Namaste REact using JSX</h1>
//         <HeadingComponent />
//         <h1 className='myHeading'>Namaste React</h1>
//     </div>
// )


// const TitleComponent = () => {
//     return <h1>Title</h1>
// }


// // root.render(<HeadingComponent />)
// root.render(jsxHeading)

2 types of Export/Import
    Default Export
    -export default Component
    -import Compnent from 'path'

    Named Export 
    -export const Component
    -import {Component} from 'path'

***PROPS***
    -properties
    -passing a argument in to function/ components
    -are normal arguments of function
    -prop is an object
    -when we want to add dynamic data. We will use props to pass data to component.
    -when passing the data using loop we have to pass a unique key
        -why? for preventing re-renter all the components
        -by using unique id we can prevent the full re-rendering.
        -for optimization
        -**Do not use the index as the keys**
        -**no keys < index < unique keys**

***CONFLICT_DRIVEN-UI***
    -website driven by data
    -eg=> based on the location we can present different ui
